# Omega App
**Note: this document is a currently a rough draft.** 

Omega is an open source platform to support the people. It allows users to create ad-hoc networks using their smartphones to be used in peaceful protest or times of emergency when 4g/5g is no longer an option, or anonymity is a top priority. Power to the people ✊

## Introduction
Peaceful protesters and peaceful demonstrations need a safe and anonymous way to communicate with each other. Omega will help protesters communicate offline and anonymously. It will help organize and alert its users to potential dangers or situations where help is needed Our goal is to build a universal platform for all people that will allow them to build features to help people, as well as help them have their voices heard.

This document provides a high-level description of Omega is a good idea to read it first. More detailed information can be found in the following documents:

## Vision and goals
- Build a react native app
- Build android ad-hoc network capabilities
- Build a simple messaging system to complete 
- Create easy to use development documentation to allow for easy collaboration
- Get community support to build in new modules and features
- Build features useful during emergencies and peaceful protest such as alerts,
messaging, location guidance to counter efforts to cut off and disperse groups (Link to possible features doc)

## Principles
The entire application will be decentralized, secure and will keep no record or data on its users. This it's arguably the most important feature, providing a safe way to organize that is tamper proof and can’t be used for evil in the wrong hands. Omega must be built completely with open source technology so it can be properly vetted by anyone to insure it is safe and secure to use.


### How it works
The Application will utilizes ad-hoc network technology to connect users together within the range of their own wifi hotspots or Bluetooth. Each connection makes the network stronger and larger. It provides a backbone for modular based features to help during peaceful protest or times of emergency, where the project can be forked to meet more specific needs.
